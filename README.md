# multisortarrays
This code snippet allows to use the CountingSort Algorithm on 2-dimensional Arrays.
These Arrays need to be copied manually into line 4 of the code (below comment # Initialize Arrays A1...At to be sorted) for the moment.
The sorted subarrays will be displayed via a "print" command.
